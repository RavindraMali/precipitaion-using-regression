matplotlib.pyplot
Provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework.

pylab combines pyplot with numpy into a single namespace. This is convenient for interactive work, but for programming it is recommended that the namespaces be kept separate.

numpy version 1.19.0 29 jun 2020

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.

pandas 1.0.5 jun 17 2020

pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

-------------------------------
pandas.DataFrame.shape

return dataset shape row column

--------------------------------
Pandas DataFrame: head() function
The head() function is used to get the first n rows. This function returns the first n rows for the object based on position. It is useful for quickly testing if your object has the right type of data in it. Number of rows to select
---------------------------------
info()

The info() function is used to print a concise summary of a DataFrame. This method prints information about a DataFrame including the index dtype and column dtypes, non-null values and memory usage.
---------------------------------------

to_numeric

The default return dtype is float64 or int64 depending on the data supplied. Use the downcast parameter to obtain other dtypes.

error='raise'

f ‘raise’, then invalid parsing will raise an exception.

If ‘coerce’, then invalid parsing will be set as NaN.

If ‘ignore’, then invalid parsing will return the input.
--------------------------------------
Pandas Series.isnull() function detect missing values in the given series object.

Pandas any() method is applicable both on Series and Dataframe. It checks whether any value in the caller object (Dataframe or series) is not 0 and returns True for that. If all values are 0, it will return False.
---------------------------------------

The describe() method is used for calculating some statistical data like percentile, mean and std of the numerical values of the Series or DataFrame. It analyzes both numeric and object series and also the DataFrame column sets of mixed data types.

---------------------------------------
In Pandas missing data is represented by two value:

None: None is a Python singleton object that is often used for missing data in Python code.
NaN : NaN (an acronym for Not a Number), is a special floating-point value

---------------------------------------
astype()
astype() method is used to cast a pandas object to a specified dtype. astype() function also provides the capability to convert any suitable existing column to categorical type. DataFrame. astype() function comes very handy when we want to case a particular column data type to another data type.
---------------------------------------------
mean()

Pandas dataframe.mean() function return the mean of the values for the requested axis. If the method is applied on a pandas series object, then the method returns a scalar value which is the mean value of all the observations in the dataframe.
-------------------------------------------------
inplace=true

When inplace = True , the data is modified in place, which means it will return nothing and the dataframe is now updated. When inplace = False , which is the default, then the operation is performed and it returns a copy of the object.
--------------------------------------------------
asanyarray


asanyarray. Convert the input to an ndarray, but pass ndarray subclasses through. Input data, in any form that can be converted to an array. This includes scalars, lists, lists of tuples, tuples, tuples of tuples, tuples of lists, and ndarrays.

-------------------------------------------------------





prcipitation 

Precipitation is water released from clouds in the form of rain, freezing rain, sleet, snow, or hail. It is the primary connection in the water cycle that provides for the delivery of atmospheric water to the Earth. Most precipitation falls as rain.




Showalter Index. Showalter Index is a measure of thunderstorm potential and severity. Especially useful when a shallow, cool layer of air below 850 mb conceals greater convective potential above.


The lifted index can be used in thunderstorm forecasting

 What is SW? SW (SWEAT= Severe Weather Threat Index) uses several variables to determine the likeliness of severe weather and tornadoes.
